Generation as an Area (Tic Tac Toe example)
Deep learning: Predicting Output (image models)

Summarization Accuracy

However not as widespread as other uses like recognition and translation

Multifaceted

Fidelity - Do we say what's
Fluency/ Coherence - Word by Word
Robustness - Are we sure?

Open Secret, many systems siri / alexa / etc uses templates
